# @gyldendal/kobber-tsconfig

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Update readmes and upgrade packages

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

Breaking changes:

- Remove react-SSR-safe icons. React consumers should now import icons from @gy√∏dendal/kobber-icons/react.
- Remove prefix "Kobber" from react components. The readme examples show component usage without these prefixes, and kobber-icons don't have them. The prefix is redundant in react components, but must be present in web components, as custom elemens must contain a dash in the element name.
- Give color attributes more semantic names: color-theme, color-level and color-variant, which is easier to read and more consistent across components. This includes splitting the complex Button component variant into simpler attributes, and avoids using wrong attribute names (as in Heading, where variant was really (color) level, but that crashed with Heading level).

Features:

- Add "use client" to kobber-icons. This avoids that consumers must write "use client" in every file importing kobber-icons.
- Add text truncating with ellipsis to Button. Since buttons have a fixed height, and will never be wider than their containers, they need this to handle more text content that that space allows.

Bug fixes:

- When Buttons have icons to the left, we now avoid reversing all button flexbox content. Reversing content does not yield correct result when the button text contains html elements (like em).

Chores:

- Remove tokens that we should not use. The number of reported unused tokens is reduced from 801 to 84. To easily get typography styles, the utility getTypographyStyles is added, to make CSS Custom Properties for all typography styles for a component.
- Components now internally use more data-attributes as css selectors, rather than less semantic class names.
- Upgrade storybook.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

Breaking changes:

- Remove react-SSR-safe components, as also server side rendering handles using client side web components. This requires consumers to do the following:
  - use ssr-dom-shim package (see [components readme](https://github.com/GyldendalDigital/kobber/blob/main/packages/kobber-components/README.md#usage))
  - in some cases component usage must be changed (as in KobberButton, where icon prop must be replaced with a slot child).
- Add init function to components and icons that consumers must call. This enables consumers to initialize different versions of components and icons in different rendering stages.

Features:

- Add checkbox group, with hierarchical option (for adding a group checkbox).

Chores:

- Automatically list components for export. This ensures that all components we make are actually exported.
- README is improved with development setup and prerequisites.
