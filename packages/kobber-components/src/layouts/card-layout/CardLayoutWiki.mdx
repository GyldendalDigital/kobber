# CardLayout

Layout for cards and card-like surfaces such as images.

## Card sizes

The smallest a card can get is <code>{minCardWidth}px</code> wide and about
<code>{Math.ceil(minCardWidth * getAspectRatioHeightValue(ValidAspectRatioHeight.Default))}px</code> tall with an aspect ratio of
<code>1:{getAspectRatioHeightValue(ValidAspectRatioHeight.Default)}</code>.<br />
The maximum number of grid columns can be set to {validMaxColumns.join(" or ")}, the cards will stretch to fit as many columns as possible.

## Column gaps

The grid column gaps are implemented using `padding` instead of `grid-gap` to make aspect ratios work.<br />


## Responsiveness

The layout does not use [media queries ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries), but instead adapts to the available width of the component using CSS grid with `auto-fill` and JavaScript to adjust aspect ratios for wide columns.<br />
The grid column gaps respond fluidly to the viewport's width to save space on small devices.

## Future improvements

When [CSS container queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_containment/Container_queries) are supported everywhere, the JavaScript used for adjusting aspect ratios for wide columns can be replaced with CSS.<br />
[CSS aspect ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/aspect-ratio) can replace the `padding-top`-hack.
