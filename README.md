# Kobber - Gyldendals designsystem

## Run locally

This project uses Yarn, so follow the directions on https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install to set up locally.

Then, run `yarn dev` for local development, or the other scripts in package.json.

Pull requests are deployed in Cloudflare. To view build logs, make your own Cloudflare user with your Gyldendal username, activate 2FA, and request an invitation to cloudflare@gyldendal.no. (This may take a day.)

### Storybook

Storybook for web components lets you choose between kobber-theme-default and kobber-theme-dark, but for now the themes are identical.
